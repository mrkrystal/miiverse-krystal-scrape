# Miiverse Krystal Scrape

Tools for archiving Miiverse posts about Krystal.



## Krystal Posts Wanted

Anything with Krystal in it, even the mention of her with text. Drawings are the most important thing, but screenshots and discussions about Krystal are also wanted. Even negative stuff. Just archive it. I will sort it out later.



## Miiverse Post Multi-Selector Tool

1. Go to a user's All Posts or Yeahs page that you suspect may have some Krystal content. (Or anywhere where multiple posts are listed.)
2. Scroll all the way to the bottom. ALL the way. Make sure that all the posts load. If there are too many, then scroll as far as you feel comfortable.
3. Open the [Google Chrome Inspector and navigate to the Console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/).
4. Paste the code in the `MiiversePostMultiSelector.js` file into your console window (inside the Google Chrome inspector).
5. Run the code with the `enter` key.
6. A button will appear next to every post on the page and all Spoilers will be revealed.
7. Scroll back up through the page, clicking on each Krystal-related post's button on the right.
8. When finished with a page, type `outputData()` into the console prompt and press `enter`.
9. Copy paste the result (a list of post ID data) into an email and send it to [mrkrystal@gmail.com](mailto:mrkrystal@gmail.com).
